```bash
# Example queries
caia query 'content:"machine learning" AND type:pdf AND ingested:>1week'
caia query 'embeddings.similar("what is inflation?", threshold=0.8)'
caia trace abc123 --show-provenance
```

### 3.2 Time Travel Capabilities
**Goal**: Historical intelligence

- [ ] Point-in-time repository checkout
- [ ] Diff-based change detection
